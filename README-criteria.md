# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

Design the following database schema containing three tables:

![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)

* ✅ **department**:

  * ✅ **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * ✅ **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

* ✅ **role**:

  * ✅ **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * ✅ **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  * ✅ **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary
  * ✅ **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

* ✅ **employee**:

  * ✅ **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * ✅ **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  * ✅ **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  * ✅ **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  * ✅ **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager
  
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * ✅ Add departments, roles, employees

  * ✅ View departments, roles, employees

  * ✅ Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

  * ✅ Update employee managers

  * 🟥 View employees by manager

  * 🟥 Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * 🟥 View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

We can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* 🟥 Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* 🟥 Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* 🟥 Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a 🟥 separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of 🟥 SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

### Hints

* You may wish to include a 🟥 `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out 🟥 [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

## Minimum Requirements

* 🟥 Functional application.

* 🟥 GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* The 🟥 command-line application should allow users to:

  * 🟥 Add departments, roles, employees

  * 🟥 View departments, roles, employees

  * 🟥 Update employee roles

## Bonus

* The command-line application should allow users to:

  * 🟥 Update employee managers

  * 🟥 View employees by manager

  * 🟥 Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * 🟥 View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* 🟥 The URL of the GitHub repository

* 🟥 A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality
